# btcdevs-gravatars



Gravatars fetched from contributors to Bitcoin related repositories and edited with magick to create little badge. Used in Bitcoin Gource project
made to be compatible with Gource but you may be interested in using them for other purposes. I hope this will be helpfull

Some are duplicates with similar names, that's for Gource.Sorry about that. It's on purpose.
