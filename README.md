# btcdevs-gravatars



Gravatars fetched from contributors to Bitcoin related repositories and edited with magick to create little badges. 
Initially used in Bitcoin Gource project but you may be interested in using them for other purposes.
I hope this will be helpfull to someone, someday.

Some are duplicates with similar names, that's for Gource.Sorry about that. It's on purpose.
